`MongoFleet <https://mongofleet.com>`_ is the very first MongoDB hosting
platform built on Docker Cloud.

Every deployment offers a highly-available MongoDB replicaset, spread
over 3 datacenters and 2 availability zones: Europe and North America.

While running on isolated docker containers, MongoFleet offers an easy,
flexible and economical way to scale up or down your infrastructure. As
the optimal ratio between storage and memory highly depends on the data
and the usage of your MongoDB database, we allow you to scale RAM and DISK
independently to better fit your needs, at the right cost.

MongoFleet integrates with `Mongoclient <https://github.com/rsercano/mongoclient>`_
to provide an easy way to manage your databases and monitor your performance,
directly from your desktop (available on Linux, Windows and Mac OSx).

Beyond automatic fail-over, daily backups of your data are kept for seven
days.

Create your account
---------------------

To get started with MongoFleet you must create an account.
Use a valid business e-mail to be able to confirm your account creation.

Create your stack
---------------------

Once your account has been validated, you can create your stack by choosing
a deployment zone (the continent where your the data instances - primary and
secondary - of your MongoDB replicaset will be deployed. At this time we
provide two deployment zones (Europe and North America) but more zones could
eventually be available in the future.

Once created (it only takes a minute or two) you should see your 3 mongo
replicas (nodes) live on your dashboard.

For every node you can see:

- its role: Primary / Secondary / Backup
- its IP and port number
- its Status : Running or Stopped

You can also display the MongoDB logs for each node.

Connect to your admin database
---------------------

By default the only database created is the admin database.
The initial connection is very simple thanks to Mongo Client,
but you can also log in in Console Mode using the connection
string that you can grab from your dashboard.

.. code-block:: sh

   Download and Install Mongo Client from your Dashboard
   Click on "Connect", then "Link your MongoFleet account"
   Fill your MongoFleet credentials and click "Link your account"

A new connection for the user "root" on the "admin" db has been created

Create a database and a user
---------------------

.. code-block:: sh

   Connect to the admin database
   Check the Management/Quick user + database creation menu
   Fill the creation form with the new user name, password and db name
   Execute the Query

A new database has been created with the created user as a "owner".

.. code-block:: sh

   Disconnect from the admin database
   Connect to your new database

Continue using Mongo Client or your favorite driver!
